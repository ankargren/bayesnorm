## Efficient Sampling of Normal Posterior Distributions

The `rmvn_bcm` and `rmvn_rue` functions allow for efficient 
sampling from normal posterior distributions. The posterior distribution
should have the form `mu= Sigma * Phi' * alpha`, where the posterior
covariance matrix is `Sigma = (Phi' * Phi + D^{-1})^{-1}` and `D` is 
a diagonal matrix.

The `rmvn_bcm` is appropriate when `n<p`, whereas `rmvn_rue` 
is typically the faster alternative when `n>p`.

The sampling routines are based on the proposals by Bhattacharya, Chakraborty 
and Mallick (2016) and Rue (2001). The former is based on 
an idea of avoiding operations in the `p` dimension in favor of working
in the `n` dimension, which is why it is preferrable when `n<p`. The
latter sampling routine instead does the opposite.

The C++ implementations are available as headers and can therefore be called
directly in C++ (e.g. via Rcpp) if necessary by other packages.
